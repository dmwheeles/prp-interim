               <p> [dictating] Monday, November 4, 1963. The--over the weekend the coup in Saigon took place. It culminated three months of conversation about a coup, conversation which divided the government here and in Saigon. Opposed to a coup was General [Maxwell] Taylor, the Attorney General [Robert F. Kennedy], Secretary [Robert N.] McNamara to a somewhat lesser degree, John McCone, partly because of an old hostility to [Henry Cabot] Lodge [Jr.] which causes him to lack confidence in Lodge's judgment, partly as a result of a new hostility because Lodge shifted his [Central Intelligence Agency] station chief; in favor of the coup was State, led by Averell Harriman, George Ball, Roger Hilsman, supported by Mike Forrestal at the White House. [Pauses.]</p>
               <p>I feel that we must bear a good deal of responsibility for it [children faintly audible
                  in background], beginning with our cable of early [sic] August in which we suggested the
                  coup. In my judgment that wire was badly drafted, it should never have been sent on a
                  Saturday. I should not have given my consent to it without a roundtable conference in
                  which McNamara and Taylor could have presented their views. While we did redress that
                  balance in later wires, that first wire encouraged Lodge along a course to which he was
                  in any case inclined. [General Paul] Harkins continued to oppose the coup on the ground
                  that the military effort was doing well. There was a sharp split between Saigon and the
                  rest of the country. Politically the situation was deteriorating. Militarily there
                  had--it had not had its effect; there was a feeling, however, that it would. For this
                  reason, Secretary McNamara and General Taylor supported applying additional pressures to
                  Diem and Nhu in order to move them. [Children audible in background.]</p>

               <p> [dictating] I was shocked by the death of Diem and Nhu. I'd met Diem with Justice [William] Douglas many years ago. He was an extraordinary character. While he became increasingly difficult in the last months, nevertheless over a ten-year period he'd held his country together, maintained its independence under very adverse conditions. The way he was killed made it particularly abhorrent. The question now is whether the generals can stay together and build a stable government or whether Saigon will begin--will turn on--public opinion in Saigon, the intellectuals, students et cetera, will turn on this government as repressive and undemocratic in the not too distant future.</p>
