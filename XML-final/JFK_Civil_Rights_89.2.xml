            <ab type="opener">President Kennedy interrupted a meeting about
                  West Germany's difficulties in buying U.S. military supplies to take a call
                  about civil rights matters from his brother, Robert F. Kennedy. Attorney
                  General Kennedy reported on a now-famous meeting he held the day before, on
                  May 24, with several high-profile African Americans. James Baldwin, the
                  celebrated writer who had recently published <emph>The Fire Next Time</emph>
                  about the frustrated state of black life in America, had arranged for a
                  group of black scholars, activists, writers, and entertainers to meet the
                  attorney general at a Kennedy residence near Central Park in New York City.
                  Among the notable figures in attendance were social scientist Kenneth Clark,
                  Martin Luther King Jr.'s attorney Clarence Jones, musician/performer Harry
                  Belafonte, actress/performer Lena Horne, and the writer Lorraine Hansberry. </ab>
               
            <ab type="opener">One of the least-recognizable figures in the room, however, stole the
                  show. Jerome Smith, a New Orleans activist with the Congress of Racial
                  Equality (CORE), opened the session by telling Kennedy that he was
                  "nauseated by the necessity of being in that room" and having to explain
                  conditions of America's cities to the attorney general. According to
                  Baldwin, "Bobby took it personally and turned away from him," infuriating
                  the others. Lorraine Hansberry chastised Kennedy, telling him that of all of
                  the people in that room, Smith was the only one "who should be listened to."
                  To Lena Horne, "this boy just put it like it was. He communicated the plain,
                  basic suffering of being a Negro. The primeval memory of everyone in that
                  room went to work after that." Kenneth Clark said that the session "became
                  one of the most violent, emotional verbal assaults . . . that I had ever
                  witnessed then or since." It was "an attack" on Kennedy. Kennedy, in his
                  view, said they "seemed possessed" and "impossible" to reach. During the
                  three hour meeting, he became defensive and then quiet, receiving an
                  unforgettable lesson that left him shocked and shaken.<note type="footnote">[footnote, Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., <emph>Robert F. Kennedy and His Times</emph> (New York: Hought0n-Mifflin, 1978), pp. 330-335, quoted material pp. 332 and 333.]</note>
            </ab>
               <ab type="opener">Unfortunately, the recorder picked up only President Kennedy's part of this day's conversation with his brother. After it, the
                  president did tell Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara that Bobby believed
                  the meeting was a "disaster" and was "the most extreme" exchange that he had
                  experienced. The transcript below is a rendering of the president's portion
                  of the call.<note type="footnote">http://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/Archives/JFKPOF-MTG-089-002.aspx</note>

               <p> We're running into some difficulty in balance of payments problems with both Germany and Canada. Germany, of course, isn't very good since we negotiated the agreement--the off-set agreements, but they in turn are running into budget difficulties. I heard this from a number of people; [West Germany Minister of Defense Kai-Uwe] von Hassel told me, and [French Defense Minister Pierre] Messmer also told me. We had long discussions with both of them separately. And, I'm afraid that we're going to have to put increasing pressure on them to ensure that they not only order from us the equipment that adds up to $600-odd million a year, but also pay for it. They're willing to order it now but not to pay, and their payments are beginning to lag. I mention this because I know that--</p>

               <p>--it will be a subject that will be discussed when you're over there, and I mention it also because von Hassel has put some pressure on me to visit Bonn, and I've been resisting it up to the present time, but he asked again that I do so, and I think probably . . . </p>
